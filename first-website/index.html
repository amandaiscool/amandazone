                <li>#1: The word “technology” makes me instantly think of Terminator or robot beep boop noises, but I love Ursala’s reminder that something like a frying pan or utilizing fire is technology. I forget that technology means anything that creates ease or solves a problem. I definitely got soft hands and since I’m a good for nothing graphic designer I often think that I should become something serious like a blacksmith or at least learn how to gut a deer to get back in touch with what my grandparents knew how to do in The Great Depression. I am such a wimp compared to them. To pivot, I definitely create websites that fit Laurel’s definitions of “website as shelf” or “website as room.” All my experiences making websites was to serve the purpose of archiving my work or other people’s work, like a shelf, or cultivating a site that I decorate like my digital bedroom.</li>
                
                <li>#2:I have a bookmark folder called “BAD SITES” and although the title is mean, I love all of those websites dearly. The biggest chunk is old VCU professor websites (which were all recently taken down but god bless Internet Archive). These were the most atrocious, but also adorable, sites that were clearly handmade. I have said this for years: when you stumble into a teacher’s 1997 html website, you know you’re in for the lesson of a lifetime. Vintage web design ran free vs. now we have very standardized ui/ux principles (that I do prefer) but it’s so fun to revisit unhinged old internet spaces back when the priority was ugly brutalist function or unhinged fun. And it does feel rebellious to return back to this in the age of templated websites, and I am excited to start.</li>
